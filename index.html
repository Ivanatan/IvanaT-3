        <h1>Welcome to Ivana Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>Hi my name is Ivana and I am a freshmen at the University of Rhode Island which was recently named by the walls street journal as the number 1 public university in New England.</p>
         <p>This website was made in CSC class to help me learn how to create my own website and it is an amazing feeling to know I was able to. The website is to get to know me and there's also a JavaScript page. In the webpage about me, you will get to know more about me. You will know what type of foods I like to eat, you will find out about my family, hobbies, and even fun facts about me. Hopefully, you enjoy getting to know me.</p>
        <p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
